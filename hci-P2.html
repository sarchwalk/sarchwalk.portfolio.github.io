                        After looking through our initial ideas, we agreed that we enjoyed the ones that involved a level of
                        punishment. We thought that developing something that produces a not-so-ideal outcome would be fun to
                        develop, and might have real applications in our lives. For our refined sketches, we iterated on the situation,
                        the punishment, and the embodiment of the contraption, as we weren't entirely sure what was the best direction
                        to go in.

        <div class="col-lg-12" style="padding:50px;">
            <p>After iterating through different situations, punishments, and embodiments, we decided to make a booby-trapped statue
                that solves the thieving problem we face everyday.
                We call this the <b>Stone Warden</b>.<br></p>
            <br><h3>Narrative Storyboard</h3>

            <p><h4>The <b>Stone Warden</b> is a statue that punishes thieves who try to steal it by spraying them with poison. The thief will then be so scared
            that they will leave in a hurry, ensuring that valuable items are left where they belong.</h4></p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12" style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px">
            <h3>Our Ideal Client</h3><br>
            <p>We see individuals who want to protect their prized possessions wanting to use the <b>Stone Warden</b>. Ideally, they would place the
            statue on display amongst their other valuable items. The <b>Stone Warden</b> should be placed so that it is the easiest valuable to access, so that
                thieves try to take it first.</p>
            <br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-12" style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px">
            <h3>Embodiment</h3><br>
            <p>The <b>Stone Warden</b> is a stone statue with bright red flashing eyes with a hidden sensor and a mouth that sprays liquids. We designed
            the statue so that the input and output was hidden from the outside, ensuring that thieves aren't aware that the statue is booby-trapped.
            <br><br>
            One of the pieces of feedback we got from our classmates was to use proximity to trigger the spray. This
            proved useful as the ultrasonic sensor, which detects proximity, was easy to disguise as eyes in the statue. Red
            LED's were also used in the eyes to flash in anger while the spray went off.
            <br><br>
            To hide the water bladder, power supply, and the Arduino, the statue was put on a pedestal which contained the items. This also
                ensured that the electronics did not get wet from the spray if it were triggered.</p>
