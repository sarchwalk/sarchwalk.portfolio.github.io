        <p>
            I am a soon to be graduate (Winter 2021) of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Calgary.
            My interests lie in product development, synthetic biology, and arduino programming.

        <p>The iGEM competition is an international synthetic biology research competition held
            yearly in Boston, Massachusetts. University teams from all over the world compete
            with projects in categories such as Therapeutics, Food and Nutrition, and Foundational Advancement.
            At the University of Calgary, the team operates under the Cumming School of Medicine as its own research group
            under the supervision of Dr. Mayi Arcellana-Panlilio.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was selected to join the team in 2018 where I focused on developing software and performed human practices work.
            In 2019 I returned as a team lead where I took on a more client facing role and pushed the team to engage with industry.

                        In 2019 the team tackled the overabundance of chlorophyll in canola seeds - dubbed the
                        "Green Seed" problem. For this project I took on a product management role, where I focused
                        on engaging with stakeholders in the agriculture industry and working with the team to
                        design solutions that would make a positive impact. This project earned recognition at the iGEM
                        competition, winning Best Human Practices, Best Software Tool, and First-Runner Up for the undergraduate
                        category in addition to numerous nominations in other categories.

                        In 2018 the iGEM Calgary team worked on a synthetic biology approach to increase the capabilities of
                        gene therapy. In addition to helping build the wiki,
                        I worked with a small team of bioinformatics and engineering students to develop
                        a web scraper alongside a text summarization tool that would be used to aggregate bioinformatics tools.
