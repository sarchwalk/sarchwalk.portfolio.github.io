            After receiving feedback from our peers, we decided to go ahead with the idea of a haunting between friends.
            After discussing different ways of achieving this, we decided on using sounds, lights, and movement
            to spook the scaree. The owl embodiment was chosen for its creepyness and for its natural mapping of sounds and
            movement.
            <br><br>
            From further discussion, we decided on going hands-free for the controls. While an app would be interesting to build,
            we wanted to create something that was so easy to use, that the user wouldn't even have to lift a finger.
            To achieve this, we built OWLECTO's controls as an action for the Google Home

                            Chicago Kardashian East is a student at the University of Calgary. She was very sad when COVID-19 forced her
                            to stay home because she loves planning social activities and hanging out with her friends (but she understands
                            her responsibility to help flatten the curve). Chicago is a big fan of horror movies and goes to ScreamFest with
                            her friends every year. She is often inspired by these experiences to play spooky pranks on her friends. She is
                            very computer literate and likes to share her newest tech finds with anyone that will listen. She finds it difficult
                            to focus on school work for long periods of time and constantly messages friends as a reprieve. Chicago has no problem
                            initiating communications and likes to check in on people in fun and inventive ways, even if they don’t always reciprocate.
                            However, sometimes when her friends don’t see her messages, she wishes there was a more obnoxious and immediate way she
                            could get their attention. Chicago just wants her friends to know she’s thinking of them, and she won’t be thwarted
                            by people who don’t regularly check their phones.

                            pranks. Though she may not admit it, Blue prefers to be the victim, because it’s a lot of work to plan
                            and execute a good scare. She is fairly tech-savvy and is open to trying out new gadgets. Unfortunately,
                            she is notorious for having her phone on silent and not reading messages at the time she receives them. Thus,
                            Blue often misses her friends’ attempts to check in and start conversations when they are socially isolated.
                            However, their small gestures bring a big smile to her face when she eventually sees them. Blue also spends
                            most of her time at her desk, busy doing school work as the semester wraps up. As such, she rarely finds time
                            to initiate online hangouts of her own, prefering to put the onus of communication on her more thoughtful friends.

            <p>The ESP8266 reads data from Adafruit IO, so to get it working with Google Assistant we had to create an action. Using Zapier, Erika created a script that
                takes the command said to Google Assistant and puts it in Google Sheets. Then, three other scripts are used to recognize when someone says "Scare",
                "Spook", and "Traumatize for Life", and then send a number corresponding to which command was given to Adafruit IO.</p>

            Challenges and Future Improvements

        The largest challenge we faced when creating OWLECTO was determining what kind of embodiment
        would be most interesting for the user. If we weren't participating in physical distancing, we
        would have liked to get feedback from potential users to improve on our design.
        <br><br>
        To improve OWLECTO, we would find and play better sound clips so that OWLECTO's hoot sound like and
        owl's hoot.
